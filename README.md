# Ripples3

Liquid code experiment

[DEMO](https://nicopowa.github.io/ripples3)

Very interesting and soothing

Learning WebGL and fluid mathematics with Claude and ChatGPT was a mistake (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻

## About

- This is experiment n°64 :) lots of funny glitches
- Add to homescreen to go fullscreen
- Running slow on low-end mobile devices, performance optimizations needed
- Simulation might be losing strength over time
- All parameters are located in Liquid class constructor
- Some of them don't change anything yet, need much more debugging
- Uncomment this line and run dev.html to enable parameters testing (very buggy)

	```const amplify = new Params(liquify);``` 

- Compiled & minified with [ClosureCompiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler) / [ShaderMinifier](https://ctrl-alt-test.fr/minifier/) / [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Soon

- Comments
- Docs
- Presets
- Rain effect
- Gyro control
- Multi screen !
